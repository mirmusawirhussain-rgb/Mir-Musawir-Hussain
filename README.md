 🎮 C++ Number Guessing Game (Dynamic Difficulty)

A logic-based console application built with C++ that challenges players to guess a secret number generated by the system. It features real-time hints and adjustable difficulty settings.

 🚀 Features
Three Difficulty Levels: - Easy (1-10)
   Medium (1-100)
   Hard (1-1000)
Randomization: Uses `srand(time(0))` to ensure unique secret numbers every session.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of how many attempts it takes to find the number.
Input Logic: Provides "Too High" or "Too Low" feedback to guide the player.
Replayability: Play multiple rounds without restarting the program.

 🛠️ Technical Breakdown
This project demonstrates proficiency in:
Loops: 'do-while' for the main game engine and replay system.
Selection: switch-case for difficulty handling and `if-else` for game logic.
Libraries: Includes <cstdlib> for random functions and `<ctime>` for system time seeding.

 📋 How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like GCC, MinGW, or Clang).
2. Download the `main.cpp` file from this repository.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt.
4. Compile the code:
   bash
   g++ main.cpp -o NumberGame
